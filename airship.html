                    <!-- <br /> -->
                    <p>The importance of water for our planet and our species cannot be understated, and hydrologists have the essential task of maintaining and testing the water deposits around the world. For this, they require accurate measurement of multiple parameters at multiple locations of any given water body. This is usually done with a multiparameter sensor stack known as a sonde. With many of these water bodies in remote and hard-to-reach locations, sending a hydrologist out to conduct water quality assessments can be difficult and time-consuming. A solution is to construct an Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV) with the sonde onboard, which would travel to these locations by air. However, current UAV technologies lack the ability to hover for lengthy periods of time while also maintaining a long vehicle range, characteristics necessary for this application of hydrology research in remote areas.</p>

                    <p>The aim of this project is to design and build an autonomous lighter-than-air UAV and payload delivery mechanism that can fly to remote bodies of water, efficiently hover over sampling locations, and deploy an industry-standard sensor array used by hydrologists to gather data about the water’s health and assess its quality. This would eliminate the need for hydrologists to travel, allowing for more efficient data collection. </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>To achieve this goal, the project responsibilities were divided between two cross-functional teams. The Vehicle Team is responsible for delivering and maintaining the vehicle airframe. The Payload Team is then responsible for designing the embedded systems to fly the vehicle and avoid obstacles, the sensor delivery mechanism, and the sampling protocol.</p>

                    <p>The team used Agile methodologies and requirements-driven design to define system requirements, plan sprint goals and tasks, as well as develop, implement, and test project components. This helped the team focus on the end user’s perspective as well as hit project milestones and provide quantifiable deliverables in an efficient and timely manner.</p>

                    <p>The diagram below is a system level breakdown of the project’s essential components.</p>

                    <p>The primary subsystems in this project include autopilot software running on the Pixhawk 4 flight controller, obstacle and water detection through computer vision algorithms, embedded software to control the sonde delivery winch mechanism running on a separate On Board Computer (OBC), as well as RF and MAVLink communication layers to connect between the two OBC boards.</p>

                    <p>My responsibility as the Vehicle Flight Software Engineer is to use open-source autopilot software (ArduPilot) to control the experimental airship and get it ready for autonomous flight. Also, as the Payload Systems Engineer, I am responsible for designing and maintaining the payload delivery and sampling protocol at a system level.</p>

                    <p>The images above show the final versions of the CAD and physically built UAV prototype. The vehicle has a central Aluminum spine with mounting points for the crucial components. </p>

                    <p>The vehicle has an A-tail ruddervator control surface followed by a STOL airfoil wing with a 104’’ wingspan to generate high lift at low speeds. The wing itself does not have ailerons as roll control is not a requirement. Next, a custom-built vectored thrust section comes to the fore of the wing. The thrust section is mounted at the vehicle’s center of gravity. After this, the flight electronics bay and payload deployment winch mechanism are also mounted to the vehicle. Finally, the 384 ft^3 helium envelope is mounted above the spine.</p>

                    <p>In summary, the vehicle has an A-tail control surface to be controlled by servos and thrust vectored propulsion from two BLDC motors whose vectors are controlled by two more servo motors.</p>

                    <p>Note: during initial testing, the team quickly noticed the spine is non-rigid and caused unstable oscillations. Also, mounting the flight controller and sensors at the center of mass instead of at the end of the spine allows for more accurate measurements of the vehicle’s state.</p>
